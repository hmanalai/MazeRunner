# MazeRunner

** MazeRunner ** 
Wrote a program that starts with an intitial starting point (S) in a map of a maze. Then finds as much treasure (T) in the cave as possible by exploring all the accessible locations. Everytime a treasure is located it will be marked by an (X) and everytime a dead-end is encountered the program retraces its steps and tries another one of the untried paths until it comes back to the starting point. Having explored all the accessible paths on the map, it exits the maze. 

Developed a recursive and backtracking algorithm that allows the exploration.
